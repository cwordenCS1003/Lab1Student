# Lab 1
**Released on** Tuesday, September 14   
**Due on** Wednesday, September 15 (24 hours after release)

**Modules Covered:** 1

## Preparation Steps:
- Have Python 3 + Text Editor downloaded on Computer  
- Have GitHub Desktop set up and submitted your email 
- Watch all modules  
- Get in touch with pair programming partner  

## Background on Pair Programming:
Pair programming has many benefits that can foster better understanding of coding. In order to perform pair programming in the online setting, you should set up a call with your partner (or group of three) during the lab time. One team member will share their screen and program while the other partner (or 2 partners) will give advice. You should switch programming every 10-15 minutes. One group member should not be doing all the programming here. When you submit your code, only one partner needs to submit. 

## Submission:
Only one person should submit the code by pushing the code on GitHub. Make sure that every submitted file has a comment at the top with all group members’ names and student numbers. 

## Additional: 
Only use the programming skills that you have learned in modules for this assignment. While there sometimes may exist solutions that are “better” through using other skills, we ask that you only use what you have been taught in the modules up to this point. We must make sure that you understand the taught material for full marks. 

 
## Exercises for Submission:
### Part 1:
By writing the following code and executing the .py file, we get output that represents CS. It is your job to write a program that outputs the first letters of all group members names on the same lines in place of the C and the S.

#### Program:

### Part 2:
Given the following geometric equations, write a print() statement for each and replace the variables with the given number for output. You must use Python to do all the calculations here. Do not just type the answer into the print statement.<br /> 

Example: Area of a Square is length * width. Assume length = 4 and width = 6. Therefore, your code should look like this:  
	print(4 * 6)  

#### Volume of a Pyramid<br />

l = 6  
w = 8  
h = 3  


#### Volume of a Cube<br />

(Use the exponent symbol here)  
a = 6  

#### Volume of a Cylinder<br />

(Use the exponent symbol here  
Π = 3.14  
r = 3  
h = 2  


#### Circumference of a Circle<br />

Π = 3.14  
r = 90.1346  


### Part 3:
You are given the following amounts of money and can only pay people back with $10 bills and $0.25 quarters. How many bills and quarters would you need for each? Write a program with two print() statements to calculate each of the amounts (one print statement for the number of bills and one for the number of quarters). You must use the integer and modulo division here. You must use Python to do all the calculations here.  Do not just type the answer into the print statement.

Tip: to get integer division and modulo division to work, you cannot be working with decimal numbers, you may have to times the amounts by 100 to work with them.

1. 20.25
2. 31.50
3. 125.75
4. 800.00
